*Arvind Yalavarti* - Arvind is a freshman who enjoys everything in software development. He's particularly experienced in working with UI/UX architecture and using React to make pleasing front-end experiences for the user. Arvind's main weakness is his dependence on existing libraries and APIs when it would be better to write it himself.

*Jeff Zhu* - Jeff is an algorithms guru who enjoys working entirely on the back-end. He despises using third-party APIs and doesn't wish to touch the front-end. Comfortable with Java, Pyret.

*Arvind Yalavarti* - Arvind is a freshman who enjoys everything in software development. He's particularly experienced in working with UI/UX architecture and using React to make awesome front-end experiences for the user. Arvind's main weakness is his dependence on existing libraries and APIs when it would be better to write it himself. Comfortable with Java, Python, React, Pyret.

*Mark Lavrentyev* - Mark is good at googling new things and figuring out how to integrate different parts of the project. He is very frightened of blank files with all those endless possibilities. Comfortable with Java, Python, Pyret, PostgreSQL, and some front-end.

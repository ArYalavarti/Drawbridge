# Project Outline

## Members

*Sam Maffa* - Sam is an all-round coding ninja (blender). He doesn't have a ton of experience with working on front-ends but is great at being flexible with working on different parts of the project. Comfortable with Java, Python, Pyret, SQL.

*Jeff Zhu* - Jeff is an algorithms guru who enjoys working entirely on the back-end. He despises using third-party APIs and doesn't wish to touch the front-end. Comfortable with Java, Pyret.

*Arvind Yalavarti* - Arvind is a freshman who enjoys everything in software development. He's particularly experienced in working with UI/UX architecture and using React to make awesome front-end experiences for the user. Arvind's main weakness is his dependence on existing libraries and APIs when it would be better to write it himself. Comfortable with Java, Python, React, Pyret.

*Mark Lavrentyev* - Mark is good at googling new things and figuring out how to integrate different parts of the project. He is very frightened of blank files with all those endless possibilities. Comfortable with Java, Python, Pyret, PostgreSQL, and some front-end.

## Project Ideas

#### Group Former & Manager
This project is a website that will allow students to find groups in classes more effectively. The current method of doing this often involves simply posting a small paragraph about yourself and hoping others will find it interesting and email you. It is also often difficult to set up places and times to meet to work on the project in a group.

We envision that this website will have two major parts - group formation and group management. Group formation will include an instructor setting up a class with a list of student's emails and a short project description. Then, students will be able to add their own project descriptions, with a few key modifications: namely, they will also input certain information such as intro sequence, their strengths, and their weaknesses (likely rated 1-5). Then, for students seeking a group, our algorithm will sort in a way as to diversify teams and spread out their strengths/weaknesses so that they can be as effective as possible. 

For the group place/time scheduling, we envision (once groups are formed), students being able to request a meeting within a group with any or all of the group members. They'll input times they would be willing to meet, and our website will send out an email when the other people respond and a proper time/place is found.

These two main features are often the bottleneck for group projects, so that is why we are choosing to focus on them. We expect that the most challenging part of this will be developing a way to sort groups for users so as to diversify them, but still present something that they are interested in.

# Drawbridge Carpool Planner

## Setup and Run Configurations

### Init Script
To build the Java Maven project, run
```
mvn package
```
in the root directory.
Environment variables for the database username/password and Mapbox API key must be properly configured. A short init script was written to streamline this process. Run
```
./init <DB_USER> <DB_PASS>
```
to set environment variables and start the application on port 8000.

### Manual Setup
To manually set environment variables, run
```
export DB_USER=<USERNAME>
export DB_PASS=<PASSWORD>
export MAPBOX_KEY=<KEY>
```
in the root directory. Then run 
```
./run â€“gui --port <PORT>
```
to start the application on the provided port.

### PostgreSQL Setup
To set up a local database on postgre, download 
PostgreSQL11 from https://www.postgresql.org/download/.
Install PGAdmin4 from https://www.pgadmin.org/download/
as well. Open PGAdmin and create a new database named
"carpools".

Right click on the carpools database and select "restore".
Use the carpoolsDump.tar file to build the database. Open
Restore Options and select the following: "schema only",, and all options under "do not save".

In the carpools database, open the query tool (lightning
symbol), and run the following commands, consistent with
the environment variables set up earlier:
* CREATE USER \<username\> WITH PASSWORD '\<password\>';
* GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO \<username\>;
* GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO \<username\>;

Maven will automatically install the JDBC driver needed 
to connect to the postgre database when "mvn package" is 
run, though it can be downloaded at 
https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html
and manually imported as an external jar file.

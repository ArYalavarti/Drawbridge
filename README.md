# Drawbridge Carpool Planner

## Setup and Run Configurations

To build the Java Maven project, run
```
mvn package
```
in the root directory. Then run 
```
./run â€“gui --port <PORT>
```
to start the application.

To set up a local database on postgre, download 
PostgreSQL11 from https://www.postgresql.org/download/.
Install PGAdmin4 from https://www.pgadmin.org/download/
as well. Open PGAdmin and create a new database.

Maven will automatically install the JDBC driver needed 
to connect to the postgre database, though it can 
be downloaded at https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html
and manually imported as an external jar file.

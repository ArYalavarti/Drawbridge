# Drawbridge Carpool Planner

## Setup and Run Configurations

### Init Script
To build the Java Maven project, run
```
mvn package
```
in the root directory.
Environment variables for the database username/password and Mapbox API key must be properly configured. A short init script was written to streamline this process. Run
```
./init <DB_USER> <DB_PASS>
```
to set environment variables and start the application on port 8000.

### Manual Setup
To manually set environment variables, run
```
export DB_USER=<USERNAME>
export DB_PASS=<PASSWORD>
export MAPBOX_KEY=<KEY>
```
in the root directory. Then run 
```
./run â€“gui --port <PORT>
```
to start the application on the provided port.

### PostgreSQL Setup
To set up a local database on postgre, download 
PostgreSQL11 from https://www.postgresql.org/download/.
Install PGAdmin4 from https://www.pgadmin.org/download/
as well. Open PGAdmin and create a new database named
"carpools".

Maven will automatically install the JDBC driver needed 
to connect to the postgre database when "mvn package" is 
run, though it can be downloaded at 
https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html
and manually imported as an external jar file.

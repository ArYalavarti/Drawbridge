# Project Outline

## Members

*Sam Maffa* - Sam is an all-round coding ninja. He doesn't have a ton of experience with working on front-ends but is great at being flexible with working on different parts of the project.
Languages: Java, Python, Pyret, SQL

*Jeffrey Zhu* - Jeffrey is an algorithms guru who enjoys working entirely on the back-end. He despises using third-party APIs and doesn't wish to touch the front-end. 
Languages: Java, Pyret

*Arvind Yalavarti* - Arvind is a freshman who enjoys everything in software development. He's particularly experienced in working with UI/UX architecture and using React and other frameworks to make awesome front-end sites. Arvind's main weakness is his dependence on existing libraries and APIs when it would be better to write it himself.
Languages: Java, Python, React, Pyret.

*Mark Lavrentyev* - Mark is good at Googling new things and figuring out how to integrate different parts of the project. He is very frightened of blank files with all those endless possibilities.
Languages: Java, Python, Pyret, PostgreSQL, and some front-end.

## Project Ideas

#### Group Former & Manager
This project is a website that will allow students to find groups in classes more effectively. The current method of doing this often involves simply posting a small paragraph about yourself and hoping others will find it interesting and email you. It is also often difficult to set up places and times to meet to work on the project in a group.

We envision that this website will have two major parts - group formation and group management. Group formation will include an instructor setting up a class with a list of student's emails and a short project description. Then, students will be able to add their own project descriptions, with a few key modifications: namely, they will also input certain information such as intro sequence, their strengths, and their weaknesses (likely rated 1-5). Then, for students seeking a group, our algorithm will sort in a way as to diversify teams and spread out their strengths/weaknesses so that they can be as effective as possible. 

For the group place/time scheduling, we envision (once groups are formed), students being able to request a meeting within a group with any or all of the group members. They'll input times they would be willing to meet, and our website will send out an email when the other people respond and a proper time/place is found.

These two main features are often the bottleneck for group projects, so that is why we are choosing to focus on them. We expect that the most challenging part of this will be developing a way to sort groups for users so as to diversify them, but still present something that they are interested in.

#### Carpooling Setup
This project is an application that allows users to efficiently carpool to nearby locations. If a student, for example, is looking to travel to another university to visit a friend, he or she can post their itenary. Other students who are also travelling to the same or nearby location can start a conversation with the primary traveller and arrange a carpool.

The application would work for different types of travel methods, including bus, train, plane, and driving. In the case for driving, the application would calculate a total cost per person based on distance and current gas prices that the members of the carpool could split up.

We envision that these carpool groups would be time-sensitive, and after a certain window, the group will close and the application will generate an itenary for the members. Only if all members of a group agree upon an itenary will the itenary be finalized and prices be calculated.

We are focusing on the problem that many students may share connections at different universities and miss out on the opportunity to carpool with others travelling to the same destination. We expect that the most challenging part of this project would be keeping track of the different groups a user is a part of, especially when time becomes an important factor in carpool formation.

#### Finance Tracker
This project is an application that helps users monitor their personal finances. It would provide an easy way to keep track of spending and saving on a short-term and long-term scale across multiple accounts and various sources of income.

One of the main features will be a "wallet" that keeps an updated record of the money in each of the user's bank accounts or cash holdings. While transactions will not be processed through this application, it should be able to keep track of all transactions that occur with the user's money. It should allow the user to categorize and record single-event transactions, such as purchases, as well as recurring transactions, such as weekly income or interest.

The other main feature will allow the user to set budgets and trace spending habits over time. The user would be able to divide out a budget between certain categories of spending, and as spending transcations are recorded, the application will inform user whether he/she is on track to be overbudget or underbudget.

As an additional feature, the application would chart budgets in relation to actual expenses over time to show long-term trends in saving and spending habits.

Each of these features is important for anyone managing their own finances, as knowing one's holdings and setting budgets allows for responsible spending. The critical challenges for this project will be security, especially if we link bank accounts, and accuracy and extremely thorough testing, as it would be very bad to misrepresent one's finances.
